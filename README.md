📋 TEAM PROJECT: SPACES FOR RENT
🏠 PROJECT OVERVIEW
Problem Statement
The main aim is to bring and develop a community of like-minded people who have the same passion in a particular area and they would really want to share the experience with other people of the passion within a cool environment generated by a willing owner.

Solution
A platform that will bring people together to meet, create, and celebrate. An online marketplace will make it easier than ever to find and book unique spaces for any activity. Space owners around the country can lease their property and make it available for rent by the hour/day for people seeking a location for their next meeting, event or activity.
